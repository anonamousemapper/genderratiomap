Fully configurable gender ratio map web app with sub-city detail

Note: This requires a DB to actually run. The scripts for creating
      the DB are in this repo, but the source data from which the
      DB is populated is too big to be stored in GitHub. Feel free
      to create an issue if you want to contact me to get the
      source files.

Start server (from app directory):
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 application:app -w 1 --threads 12

Disclaimer: I made this by myself for myself to learn a bit about
            web apps. Figured other people might find it
            interesting though.
